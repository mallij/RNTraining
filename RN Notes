5. JSON Objects
6. Typeof
7. Diff between undefined & null
8. == vs ===

ECMA - 

ES5, ES6 , ES7…


Declaring / Creating Variables


3 keywords to create/declare variables

1. var - Can reassign the values, can redeclare the variable
2. const - Cannot re assign, cannot redeclare the variable
3. let - Can reassign the value, cannot redeclare the variable (loops) - is used in block specific access

Hoisting -  All the variable declarations are moved to the top of the scope before executing the code


Data Types

1. Number
2. String
3. Boolean
4. Array
5. Object
6. Null
7. Undefined
8. Command


Arrays :

forEach - Same as traditional for loop but don’t need to write boiler plate code

map() - we can apply some operation over each element of the array

Filter - can apply some condition over each element and can return the set/array of the elements that satisfies the given condition

Promise => A Description of task whose output/result is not know at that point of time 
		- A representation of an asynchronous operation


Asynchronous => Success / Failure 

Promise => Resolved / Rejected

fetch(URL)
.then((value) => {
// Then represents positive/ promise is resolved
    console.log(value);
  })
  .catch((err) => {
	// catch represents negative/ promise is rejected.
    console.error(err);
  });



React Native

1. Native - Android, iOS, etc
2. Hybrid - Can create applications that are compatible with more than on OS 
        1. Flutter
        2. Ionic
        3. PhoneGap/Cordova
        4. React Native

Android - iOS

Hello App

 <Text> Hello App <Text>

	Other Hybrid => convert the code into web content => loads the application with the help of a web view

	React Native => <Text> Hello App <Text>

	=> App is loaded => Android => <TextView> Hello App </TextView>

	=> App is loaded => iOS => <UILabel> Hello App </UILabel>



Day 2


Java latest version
Android Studio


Download iInstall

Node - https://nodejs.org/en/download/

After node installed, Open a terminal and run 

npm install react-native

Then run 

sudo gem install cocoapods

Once done,

Create a Workspace folder in finder

Open a new terminal and move to the workspace folder using cd commands

Windows Machine Users to Set up Android



Day 3

Hot Reloading -> Reloading only the modified content / file

Live Reloading -> Run the application / Reloading the application through the run command

User Interface in RN

Basic Building blocks of RN UI

Text - To print/ render labels / Strings - TextWrap

Button - to trigger an action

TouchableOpacity - Opacity changes when button is clicked
TouchableHighlight - highlights the component when clicked
TouchableWithoutFeedback - No changes will be exhibited when clicked

TextInput - Textbook in RN to take input from the user

Image - To render icons/images

View - it is container which defines the arrangement of the elements/components on the screen


——— Basic Building blocks ——— 


Alert - In built Popups = Predefined components whose look and feel can be modified

Modal - Popups - Can be customised

ScrollView - used to scroll through the content in vertical and horizontal manner
	- Loads all the elements/content at the time rendering

FlatList - Display list of items - renders/loads only the set of elements which are shown on the screen which is called lazy loading.

SectionList - Displays separate lists of items with headers (section name/title)

Pressable - Alternative for button


The content (variables declared inside the component) of any React component can be of two types

1. Normal content - The variables and objects that are created as we do in javascript functions. Whenever there is a change in this type of content, the component will not reload and always have the old values of these variable and objects.
2. State content - The variables and objects that are part of the component state. Whenever there is a change in this type of content, the component will reload and always have the latest values of these variable and objects.


Functional Vs Class Components

ErrorBoundary - can only be used in Class Components


Day 4
 export - if export is used to export a function/variable/class, it is called named export and we can export any number of components with just export statement.

While importing the names of the components are to be same as with which they are created/exported and should be enclosed within { }

export default - when ‘export default’ is used to export it is normal import and only one component can be exported from a file by using ‘export default’.

While importing the names of the components don’t need to be same as with which they are created/exported and should not be enclosed within { }

There are some features which are specific to Class components

	1) State
	2) Component Life Cycle
	3) Redux

In order make these class component features available in functional components, the concept of Hooks is introduced

	1) State : useState
	2) Component Life Cycle - useEffect
	3) Redux - useDispatch & useSelector
	4) useCallback => 
	5) useMemo
	6) useEffect vs useCallback vs useMemo
	


Day 5

Navigation - different types are there - Stack, Tab, Drawer

Install the following libraries

npm install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context 

npm  i @react-navigation/native


Stack Navigation - npm i @react-navigation/native-stack


Day 6 


TAB Navigation

npm install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context 

npm  i @react-navigation/native


npm install @react-navigation/bottom-tabs


Drawer Navigation

npm install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context 

npm  i @react-navigation/native


npm install @react-navigation/drawer

npm I  react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated.



Redux - This is a concept of Application State / Global State - Common place where every component of the application
Can read or write data to it.

Store : (Application State) - This is the place where the data is stored - Plain JSON Object Representation

Reducer - It is a function that have direct access to the store to make modifications to the store data

Action - The change that has to be performed on the Store. It is a plain JSON Object that contains the ACTION Name (type) & input data (payload)

User will trigger/dispatch an action through the UI =>


useDispatch - to dispatch actions to the reducers
useSelector - to read the data from redux state/ redux store/ global state


Redux Libraries : redux and react-redux

Day 7

Redux in Class Component -

	mapStateToProps - Which is going to be used to read data from redux

	mapDispatchToProps - Which is used to dispatch actions / update redux

	connect - react-redux

Export default connect (mapStateToProps, mapDisptachToProps)(ComponentName)


Component Life Cycle:

componentWillMount() - Whenever the component is about to be loaded / to be shown on the screen for the first time, we say Component is going to mount

componentDidMount() - Whenever the component is loaded/shown on the screen for the first time, we say Component is mounted

componentDidUpdate() - Whenever there is a change in the state/props of the component of change in the redux data, we  say Component is updated

componentWillUnmount() - Whenever the current component is about to be removed from the stack (clicking back button) the we say component will be unmounted - Unmounting 

useEffect() - one of the hooks that can be used to make use of life cycle events if not used to manage different states of a component

(…) => spread operator can be used to

1. Used as a parameter to a function (rest operator)
2. Creating a copy of an object (JSON Object) 
	- Shallow Copy - When we create a copy of an object just by copying the reference
	- Deep Copy - is copy that will be created that includes the content/ it will be a new object
		- By using spread operator
		- by using assign function in Object



To Store the data to persistent storage, we can use some libraries like AyncStorage (Deprecated), EncrptedStorage to store the data in the form of key - value pairs

npm i react-native-encrypted-storage  

	Android - SharedPreferences
	iOS : KeyChain

Day 8 : 

Database Management using RealM - MongoDb

data types in realm 

bool, int, double, Decimal128, string, date, data, objectId

DataTypes of realm => 

- realm - npm i realm
    - Creating Database
    - Creating Tables
    - Insert, update, delete & select  


Two tables in realm can be related by referencing a column of other table

One to one

One to many

https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sdk/react-native/fundamentals/relationships-and-embedded-objects/

Realm Studio is a tool to visualise data saved in relamdb file


Fragment : To bind multiple elements as a single entity while returning from a function or condition without adding an extra level in view hierarchy of the component

Debug Menu

iOS - Command + D
Android - control + M => ctrl + M

Join Tables with Primary key and foreign key -  https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sdk/react-native/fundamentals/relationships-and-embedded-objects/#std-label-react-native-to-one-relationship


OS Specific Implementation

Platform -> Platform.os => {‘ios’ , ‘android’};

1. When some part of the screen has to be implemented according to OS
2. Loading completely two different components/screens one for each OS
3. Native Bridging => We write native android & iOS code and invoke/call that native code from React Native Code - https://reactnative.dev/docs/native-modules-android


Day 9

API/WebService - Calling => fetch, axios => Promise => Asynchronous operations

Promise - it represents an asynchronous operation => Success - Resolved / Failure = rejected

Promise.then((response) => Process Response => Show success message/output to the user)
	.error((error) => Show Error Message to the user)

fetch - inbuilt component

axios - third library

1. Fetch don’t parse the response automatically, but axios does
2. Cancel the API call in between / before it is completed is possible with axios but not with fetch


API Middleware 

npm install redux-thunk

Custom Fonts

1. Download the font definitions/ttf files : https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/list/popular
2. Copy the ttf files in to your project
3. Create assets/fonts in your src and then add all font ttf files in it
4. Create a file name ‘react-native.config.js’ in the root folder
5. Copy the following content in the above created file

react-native.config.js

module.exports = {
    project: {
        ios: {},
        android: {}
    },
    assets: ['./src/assets/'],
};	

6. Now run  npx react-native-asset


<Text style={{fontFamily: 'Roboto', fontSize: 38}}>Wow Such Title</Text>


Day 10

Dropdown - react-native-element-dropdown
npm i react-native-element-dropdown

https://github.com/hoaphantn7604/react-native-element-dropdown

https://www.sitereq.com/post/3-steps-to-add-react-native-dropdown-list-to-your-project#:~:text=The%20three%20steps%20of%20adding,will%20render%20the%20drop%2Ddown

https://blog.logrocket.com/creating-custom-react-native-dropdown/



Styled Components

npm i styled-components  

https://www.npmjs.com/package/styled-components

Styled components can be used to create styled version of React native components for

1. View
2. Text
3. TouchableOpacity
4. Image
5. StyleSheet
6. ScrollView

UnitTesting

A component in RN can be of two types

1 - UI Component - Component that can render/draw something on the screen
2 - Utility component - Component that does render anything on the screen, but can take some input and should give some result back

Using jest testing framework (in-build testing library) we can test/write unit test scripts only for above two types of components
We cannot write scripts for the component that has some user inputs (Entering text in the text box, button click, etc) associated with it.

For such events to be tested, we can use @testing-library/react-native

npm i @testing-library/react-native 

1. Normal Util components
2. UI Component Render test (Snapshot)
3. Events Testing

A "component snapshot" is a JSX-like string created by a custom React serializer built into Jest. This serializer lets Jest translate React component trees to string that's human-readable.

A Snapshot is created when the component is created (Not when we make changes)

To write test cases related to a Component, if the component name is  MyComponent.js, then it’s related unit test script file has to be named as MyComponent.test.js

Once we are done with writing the test scripts, we have to run <npm test> from the root folder of our project 

Whenever the component is modified, we have to update the snapshot of that component, to update the snapshot run the command <npm test -- -u> from root folder of your project.

For test coverage run the command <npx jest --coverage> from the root folder of your project

Date Picker

npm install react-native-date-picker

-----

Splash Screen

npm i react-native-splash-screen

Android : 

1. Update MyApplication.java

	Add the following import int the top of MyApplication.java and 

	import org.devio.rn.splashscreen.SplashScreenReactPackage;
	import com.facebook.react.shell.MainReactPackage;

	replace the following code in the MyApplication.java for getPackages method

	@Override
	protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
   	 return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(
            new MainReactPackage(),
            new SplashScreenReactPackage()  //here
   	 );
	}

2. Copy the following code in MainActivity.java
	
	Add the below import in MainActivity.java

	import android.os.Bundle;

protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        SplashScreen.show(this);  // here
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    }

3. Create a file called launch_screen.xml in app/src/main/res/layout and paste the following content in it
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<RelativeLayout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    android:orientation="vertical" android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent">

    <ImageView
        android:layout_width="200dp"
        android:layout_height="200dp"
        android:layout_centerInParent="true"
        android:src="@mipmap/ic_launcher"
        android:scaleType="centerCrop" />

</RelativeLayout>

4. In App.js or the first screen of your app, add the following code
	
	import SplashScreen from 'react-native-splash-screen'

	componentDidMount() {
    	// do stuff while splash screen is shown
        // After having done stuff (such as async tasks) hide the splash screen
        SplashScreen.hide();
    }


Configuring SplashScreen in iOS

1. Update AppDelegate.m with the following additions:

	#import "RNSplashScreen.h"
 
	@implementation AppDelegate

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{
    // ...other code

    // or
    //[RNSplashScreen showSplash:@"LaunchScreen" inRootView:rootView];
[RNSplashScreen show];  // Add this line in didFinishLaunchingOptions
    return YES;
}

Add this ‘[SplashScreen show]’ after the call to [self.window makeKeyAndVisible]; in the above method  ‘didFinishLaunchingWithOptions’

2. Customize your splash screen via LaunchScreen.storyboard or LaunchScreen.xib
